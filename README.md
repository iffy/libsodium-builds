This is a repository for building libsodium so that I don't have to rebuild repeatedly in other places.

To make a new build:

1. Push a branch to GitHub
2. See if it succeeds
3. If it does, merge that into the `master` branch
4. Push `master` branch to GitHub and a release will automatically be created
